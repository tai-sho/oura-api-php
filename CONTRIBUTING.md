## Development
### Using Docker for Development
We provide a Docker setup to ensure a consistent development environment. To use Docker:
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker-compose build
```
2. Run the development environment:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
```
3. Use the php environment:
   ```sh
   docker-compose exec app bash
```

The Docker setup will automatically install dependencies and run tests, code style checks and static analysis.

### Code Style and Analysis
Please ensure your code adheres to our coding standards and passes all checks:
1. PHP-CS-Fixer: Ensures code style consistency.
   ```sh
   vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config=.php-cs-fixer.php --diff --allow-resky=yes
```
2. PHPStan: Performs static analysis to detect potential issues.
   ```sh
   vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c phpstan.neon
```
3. PHPMD: Checks for code smells and potential bugs.
   ```sh
   vendor/bin/phpmd src text phpmd.xml
